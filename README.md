# OpenActive Programme Data Directory

## Introduction
Structured programmes, which are represented using the `Brand` schema.org type, are included in the Modelling Opportunity Data 2.0 specification.

Programmes are a great way for you to associate recognised brands with opportunities. They appear alongside the activity listing, and do not replace the other fields that you are publishing. For example: for a specific "Back to Netball" regular session, you might have already included a photo of the regular group of attendees as part of the `EventSeries` or `SessionSeries`, so that the session feels approachable - as per the OpenActive recommendation. Adding an additional `programme id` and associated details will also link a description of "Back to Netball" as a wider intiative, and include the "Back to Netball" logo.

## Usage
Programmes and the [Programme Catalogue](https://openactive.io/programme-catalog/) are featured in the Gladstone OpenActive Implementation and associated documentation.
