  "description": "60 minutes of 'you time' on a badminton court – time to socialise, to de-stress, to keep fit, to compete, to challenge yourself.
Whatever your reason for joining like minded people on court, No Strings Badminton is our hugely popular 'pay and play' initiative that continues to delight players.
Designed to suit around your schedule, you’ll come off that court feeling fantastic whether you’ve won, lost or drawn.
It’s a weekly appointment you’ll want to put in your diary and keep.",
